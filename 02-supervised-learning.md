# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

## Parameters

The majority of them are either speed optimizations or for very special use cases.

## Linear Models

$$
Å·= w[0] * x[0] + w[1] * x[1] + ... + w[p] * x[p] + b
$$

### Linear Regression

- LinearRegression
- Ridge
- Lasso

Alpha: regularization parameter
higher alpha, lower coefficients, higher regularization

### Linear Classification

- LogisticRegression
- LinearSVC

C: strenth of regularization
lower C, lower coefficients, higher regularization

L2 regularization. Try this first.
L1 regularization. Some coefficients are zero.

## Naive Bayes Classifiers

GaussianNB: applied to any continuous data
BernoulliNB: binary data
MultinomialNB: count data

> BernoulliNB and MultinomialNB are mostly used in text data classification.

## Decision Tress

DecisionTreeRegressor
DecisionTreeClassifier

## Ensemble

### bagging

random forests

### Boosting

grandient boosting(GBM)
XGBoost
Light GBM

## Support Vector Machines

lower gamma, lower complexity
smaller C, more restricted model
