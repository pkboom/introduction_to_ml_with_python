# Unsupervised Learning

## Principal component analysis(PCA)

```py
PCA(n_components=100, whiten=True, random_state=0)
```

We enable the whitening option of PCA, which rescales the principal components to have the same scale.

The StandardScaler in scikit-learn ensures that for each feature the mean is 0 and the variance is 1, bringing all features to the same magnitude. However, this scaling does not ensure any particular minimum and maximum values for the features.

## Non-negative matrix factorization(NMF)
