You should think about what kind of question you want to answer.

- Do you want to do exploratory analysis and just see if you find something interesting in the data?
- Do you already have a particular goal in mind?

If you have such a goal, before building a system to achieve it, you should first think about

- how to define and measure success
- what the impact of a successful solution would be to your overall business or research goals.

> It is best if you can measure the performance of your algorithm directly using a business metric, like increased profit or decreased losses.
