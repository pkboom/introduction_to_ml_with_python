#### Dimensionality reduction

First, we need to define a new coordinate system (by rotating the original one) in which the transformed features are independent.

Then we need to sort these features based on the amount of information that they hold and eliminate one or more features that are ranked lower than the others.

PCA roughly follows the same procedure. The only difference is that it finds a coordinate system in which the features are uncorrelated.
