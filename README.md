### Installing packages with conda:

If you already have a Python environment set up, and you are using the `conda` package manager, you can get all packages by running

    conda install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas pillow graphviz python-graphviz

For the chapter on text processing you also need to install `nltk` and `spacy`:

    conda install nltk spacy
